# Tur-IrcAdmin. A script for lazy people to do just     #
# about anything as if logged on to the site.           #
#                                                       #
# Who do I recomend to run this? Well, nobody since if  #
# you accidently allow someone access to this who       #
# shouldnt, he/she can do anything basically.           #
#                                                       #
# The tcl is locked to a single chan that the executor  #
# must be in and it is also locked by default so the    #
# user must be added to THIS bot with flag o (just      #
# being an @ is not enough).                            #
# By THIS bot, I mean the one that the tcl is loaded on #
#                                                       #

#--[ Info ]---------------------------------------------#
#                                                       #
# Thats about it. If you want to try it from shell, you #
# must specify a name as first argument for logging     #
# purposes. Dosnt have to be any existing user. For     #
# example: tur-ircadmin.sh ostnisse user turranius      #
# would show userinfo for turranius and log it as if    #
# ostnisse ran the command.                             #
#                                                       #
# Make sure to lock it tight in the tcl so nobody can   #
# use it unless you want them too.                      #
#                                                       #

#   1.3.1 : Added some more cleanup for crap that would #
#           appear on some distros.                     #
#                                                       #
#           A new option called "clean".                #
#           Here we define what not to show, but dont   #
#           play with this one if you do not understand #
#           the format.                                 #
#           Just a standard egrep -v "$clean" line.     #
#                                                       #
#     1.3 : Now uses 'ftp' instead of 'ncftp'. Someone  #
#           sent me a diff on tur-addip for doing this  #
#           which I forgot. Lost the email but found    #
#           diff file which I used. Let me know who you #
#           are to be credited properly :)              #
#                                                       #
#           Should help those who had "unknown terminal"#
#           errors and similar with ncftp.              #
#                                                       #
#           If upgrading, make sure to test it first.   #
#           hostname should no longer have ftp://       #
#                                                       #
#     1.2 : Added a filter for that "Thank you for      #
#           using NcFTP Client" messages that NcFTP     #
#           spits out randomly.                         #
#                                                       #
#           Changed 'ncftp' to '$ncftp'. Previously it  #
#           would ignore the ncftp argument and only    #
#           work if the ncftp binary was in your path   #
#           which it, obviously, is for me =)           #
#                                                       #
# Tcl 1.1 : Just changed the mainchan arg to mainchania #
#           It used the same as tur-addip so if you had #
#           both, one of them didnt work.               #
#                                                       #
