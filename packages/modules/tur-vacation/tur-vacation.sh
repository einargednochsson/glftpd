# Tur-Vacation. A simple way to go on vacation.             #
# Tired of people telling you they are going on vacation?   #
# Tired of having to add users to excuded list in the trial #
# script? Well, NO MORE. heh. Heres how it works:           #
#                                                           #
# Users issue a command from site. 'site vacation on yes'   #
# What it mainly does is add that user to a group. That     #
# group is already (by you) excluded in your trialscript so #
# they will not be automatically delled or something.       #
#                                                           #
# But this script can do two more things to the user.       #
# 1: It can prevent him from downloading while on vacation. #
# 2: it can prevent him from uploading while on vacation.   #
# It does this by setting max_sim_down and/or max_sim_up to #
# 0.                                                        #
# Thus they can log in and look around, but not much else.  #
#                                                           #
# It also has a minimum time that must have passed since    #
# they went on vacation, until they can turn vacation off   #
# again. This is so they cant go on vacation at the end of  #
# each month.                                               #
#                                                           #
# As with v1.4, it can work together with Tur-Trial 2.1+    #
# so that if a user was on vacation for half the month, he  #
# should only need to upload half the quota limit to pass.  #
# This is not used for tur-trial v3+, but I'll leave the    #
# function for those that dont use v3 yet.                  #
# For Tur-Trial v3+, you simply define the same group as    #
# "Vacation group" as you do in this script. Thats all.     #
# See Tur-Trial v3+'s documentation.                        #
#                                                           #
# You can also issue the command 'site vacation status' to  #
# get a status report of everyone on vacation as well as    #
# manually add or remove users from vacation.               #
#                                                           #

# TRIALDATA= If you are using Tur-Trial 2.1+ for monthly    #
#            quota, set this file to point to the same file #
#            as VACATIONDATA in Tur-Trial.conf. It will     #
#            use this seperate file to check how long the   #
#            user was on vacation and deduct those number   #
#            days from the users quota limit.               #
#            Set a # infront of this one to disable it.     #

#            vacation ONCE in each month to prevent abuse.  #

# Changelog:
#
# 1.10  : * Now with proper glftpd 2+ support. When added to
#           the vacation group, 0 is added to the end of the
#           groupline in the userfile as it should be.
#           This is added by glftpd itself whenever the user
#           logs in, but sometimes they just go on vacation
#           and log out. Some scripts does not like when the
#           0 (or 1) is missing, like tur-trial3+.
#
# 1.9.1 : * If you only used BLOCKDN="TRUE" or BLOCKUP="TRUE"
#           and not both, it would not restore the slots for the user
#           when they got back from vacation.
#
# 1.9   : * Added another check when trying to go on vacation.
#           Previously it only checked the DB if the user was already
#           on vacation. Now, it also checks that the user isnt already
#           in the vacationgroup so we dont add him again.
#
#           This was added because admins someones tried to manually remove
#           people from vacation and would screw up the system.
#           Should instead use the deluser command added in 1.8 to do this.
#
#         * DATEBIN setting can now be left at "" to use date from your path
#           instead of a predefined one.
#
#         * LOG setting renamed to GLLOG.
#
#         * MSS integration for those running that. See readme.mss for that.
#
# 1.8   : Fixed a possible date error (remove initial 0 from month).
#         Caused problems for some bash version apparently).
#
#         Added two new commands for admins. adduser and deluser.
#         With these, you can put users on and off vacation, as long
#         as you are an administrator, controlled by the ADMINFLAG
#         setting (same as for checking status).
#         Run it without arguments for help. If you have one of the
#         adminflags, you'll see the help for status/adduser/deluser.
#
#         When doing the above, the normal limit for when you can come
#         back from vacation does not count. As admin, you can add someone
#         and then remove them again just as fast. The only limit is that
#         this can only be done once a month.
#         However, should someone go on vacation by mistake, you can let
#         them "free" again using 'site vacation deluser <username>' and 
#         bypass the limit.
#
# 1.7   : Moved default location of DB from /tmp to /etc
#
#         A flaw was found in the interaction with tur-trial.
#         If the user came back from vacation, tur-trial didnt
#         know this so it just kept deducting credits from the
#         quota limit even though they were back.
#         Now, tur-vacation writes a third value in the
#         TRIALDATA file. Its when the user came back from vacation.
#         Upgrade tur-trial too if you are using the interaction.
#
# 1.6.1 : When coming back from vacation, it didnt always
#         recognize that the user are currently on vacation and
#         would tell him/her "not found in the DB and need
#         a siteop to restore you". Thats now fixed.
#
# 1.6   : Added an option when checking status: clean
#         This will clean out purged users ( not deleted ) from
#         the vacation db.
#         To set who can do this, a setting was added below:
#         ADMINFLAG='1|7'
#         Meaning that users with flag 1 and 7 can do this.
#         Encapsule in '' and seperate flags with |
#
#         When checking status, it will show if a user is deleted
#         ( flag 6 ) and those deleted & purged ( no userfile ).
#
#         Changed it into proc's instead of just going from top
#         to bottom. Helps upgrades etc.
#
#         Changed all awk's to cut. Changed all grep -w FLAGS
#         to grep "^FLAGS "
#
# 1.5   : Some changes in regards to TRIALDATA, added in 1.4.
#
#         A user can only go on vacation once every month.
#
#         If a user is already in the TRIALDATA file when
#         going on vacation, it will remove previous instances
#         and just add this new one.
#
#         Some distros does not have a GNU compliant date bin
#         which was required for the TRIALDATA part. It made it
#         impossible to use date to get the number of seconds
#         sometimes. I now make those calculations manually
#         instead, just using 'date +%s' so it should work
#         on, for instance, freebsd too.
#
#         Also added the setting DATEBIN so you can specify
#         its location.
#
#         For reasons unknown, I removed the userdata from
#         the TRIALDATA file when you went OFF vacation.
#         That should ofcourse no be done.
#
# 1.4   : Added TRIALDATA. A seperate DB file used by 
#         Tur-Trial 2.1+ to deduct credits from quotalimit
#         if the user was on vacation this month.
#         Its disabled with a # by default. If you enable it,
#         create the file and chmod 777 on it.
#
#         NOTE: If you are just upgrading, current vacation
#         users will NOT be effected by this. They need to
#         get out of vacation and back in again for this to
#         work.
#
# 1.3   : It switched the upload and download slots when a 
#         user came back from vacation.. oops.
#
# 1.2   : Counted 12 hours instead of 24 per day, giving the
#         wrong days count in status check.
#
# 1.1   : When doing a status check, it kept going down the
#         script instead of exiting. Not a big deal as nothing
#         happened *usually*.
