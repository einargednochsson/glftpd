Changelog for tur-precheck.sh

1.6	  * Optimized code
	
1.5   * Added setting DENY_WHEN_NO_SFV="\.r[a0-9][r0-9]$ \.0[0-9][0-9]$ \.mp[2|3]"

        This will block those files from being uploaded if there is no .sfv file in
        the directory first. This is somewhat better then the check in, for example,
        pzx-ng, since its a PRE check so its blocked instantly. pzs-ng is a POST check
        so the file will be uploaded before its blocked, wasting time and bandwidth.
        See README for full usage.

1.4.1 * The check if the file uploaded exists in the .sfv file is no longer
        case sensitive. Thats what you get for "borrowing" code =)

1.4   * DENY_SFV_IN_SAMPLE_DIRS = TRUE/FALSE added to script. With this set on 
        TRUE, it will not allow .sfv files to be uploaded in Sample dirs.


1.3.1 * The NOFTPRUSHNFOS="TRUE" setting worked if the nfo was called blala(9).nfo
        but not for blala(10).nfo (and up). If the number was higher then 9, it was 
        not blocked. Thanks dlight for the report.


1.3   * Changed from reading the zipscript dir to reading the .sfv file directly.
        This makes it, once again, work with newer pzs-ng and is not depending
        on any zipscript.

        4 new settings at the top to control this. If updating, you're better
        of just replacing the script and reconfigure it from scratch.


1.2.1 * Fixed the NOFTPRUSHNFOS feature.. blocked more then it should have.


1.2   * Added option NODOUBLENFO

      * Added option NOFTPRUSHNFOS

      * Added a few more BAD files to the BANNED setting.

      * Added configuration changes in README for how to get it
        to announce in pzs-ng.

      * Added example zipdatadir= for pzs-ng.

      * Added this fancy changelog file =)


1.1   * Good question.. Dont remember.


1.0   * Yeah.. this this is when it was released.
